Been a while I used github so I'm just making sure I remember the basics

Hey!
So excited to take the software engineering course this semester. Been a while I used Github (I guess i already stated that)
I of course couldn't have forgotten how to use it but following the github tutorial did not seem like a bad idea.
Well, I hope to really gain some good experience this semester so I am pretty much excited.
I've got lot of work cut out for sure but then, this should be fun.
